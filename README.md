SubscriptionLists-Contacts
==========================

Allows for tracking a contact's "subscriptions" to various lists via checkbox and picklist field on the contact. Tracks subscribes and unsubscribes, as well as start and end date of a subsciption. Also some demo code that shows a contact unsubscribing from a list via response on a campaignmember record.
